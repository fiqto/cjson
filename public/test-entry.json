        "articleContentPart1": "<p><strong>Singapore, 10 March 2025 - </strong>City Developments Limited (CDL) has unveiled the CDL EcoTrain, Singapore’s first decommissioned SMRT train cabin repurposed and transformed into a vibrant hub for sustainability education. Powered by solar energy, this zero-energy train cabin features interactive displays, hands-on exhibits and workshops co-created with Just Keep Thinking (JKT), Singapore’s largest science and sustainability social media platform. Designed to spark environmental awareness among children and youths, the CDL EcoTrain, located at City Green, the urban park at Singapore’s first eco-mall City Square Mall, is a creative approach to community engagement and climate education.</p>\n<figure><em><img src=\"{asset:270247:url||https://www.cdl.com.sg/assets/img/en-newsroom-press-release/Group-shot_EcoTrain-Opening_Press-Release_Desktop.jpg}\" alt=\"\" /></em><figcaption><em>Guest-of-Honour President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, CDL’s senior management team and management representatives from LTA, SMRT, NParks, and JKT, at the launch of the CDL EcoTrain.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The CDL MicroForest, a 2,800 square feet (sq ft) regenerative tropical microforest, developed in collaboration with experts in ecology and biological sciences from the National University Singapore (NUS), and with inputs from the National Parks Board (NParks), was also launched today. This pioneering nature-based solution for cooling through greening aims to combat urban heat and biodiversity loss in high-density urban landscapes, serving as a living laboratory to study how microforests can lower temperatures, boost biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience.</p>\n<p>The event was graced by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a tree-planting ceremony alongside representatives from CDL, NParks, NUS, as well as young eco-champions. This symbolic event underscores the strength of the 3P (Public, Private and People) partnership model in advancing urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL’s Group Chief Executive Officer,</strong> said, \"Climate action thrives on the power of 3P collaboration and innovation. We created the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest as sustainable showcases to complement our ongoing revamp of City Square Mall. Since its opening in 2009, City Square Mall has established itself as Singapore’s first eco-mall, home to innovative community spaces for sustainability events and education, such as the Singapore Sustainability Academy. The timely launch of the EcoTrain and MicroForest enhances the Mall’s unique position as a family-friendly eco-hub with exciting programmes to nurture future eco-champions and promote sustainable living.”</p>\n<figure><em><img src=\"{asset:270248:url||https://www.cdl.com.sg/assets/img/en-newsroom-press-release/Tree-Planting-Ceremony_EcoTrain-Opening_Press-Release_Desktop.jpg}\" alt=\"\" /></em><figcaption><em>Tree Planting Ceremony at the CDL MicroForest led by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, along with CDL’s senior management team, representatives from NUS, NParks, and JKT, as well as young eco-champions from CDL’s “We Love Our Planet” storytelling contest.</em></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The CDL EcoTrain, part of the Land Transport Authority’s (LTA) upcycling initiative which repurposes decommissioned SMRT cabins, is the first public-facing repurposed train located at a retail mall.</p>\n<p><strong>Mr Ng Lang, LTA’s Chief Executive</strong>, said, “The donation of a train cabin to CDL is a meaningful step in advancing our sustainability and upcycling efforts. It reflects our commitment to work with community partners to spread the message of care for our environment that is core to the values of public transport. We look forward to exploring more such collaborations to give our decommissioned trains a new lease of life.” </p>\n<p><strong>Mr Lam Sheau Kai, SMRT Trains’ President</strong>, said, “We are pleased to collaborate with CDL on this meaningful initiative to repurpose a decommissioned train cabin into an Eco-Train for the community. As the first of its kind, the Eco-Train aims to inspire the community to adopt greener lifestyles while deepening awareness of sustainability. Guided by our core belief in ‘Do Right, Do Good, Do Well,’ SMRT Trains remains fully committed to promoting public transportation as a key pillar in building a greener and more sustainable future for all.”</p>\n<p>The creation of the MicroForest is an extension of CDL’s long-standing commitment to sustainability and integrating nature in the built environment. Since 2010, CDL has also been voluntarily conducting biodiversity impact assessments (BIAs) on greenfield sites located within or adjacent to natural habitats before construction. Environmental mitigation measures are also undertaken where necessary.</p>\n<p><strong>Ms Hwang Yu-Ning, NParks’ Chief Executive Officer</strong>, shared, “CDL has partnered with NParks on several initiatives that contribute to climate resilience over the years. This includes climate-related exhibitions at the CDL Green Gallery at the Singapore Botanic Gardens and fundraising activities under the Garden City Fund, NParks’ registered charity and IPC. We are happy to offer NParks’ expertise on the planting palette for their latest initiative. This innovative project provides public with the opportunity to experience a tropical forest in the midst of an urban shopping space. We hope this initiative will encourage greater interest in the natural environment and enhance public awareness of the diverse tree species found in our forests.”</p>\n<p>The CDL EcoTrain will be open to the public from 15 March 2025, from 11.00 am to 7.00 pm (on weekdays) and 11.00 am to 8.00 pm (on weekends).
